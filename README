This repository holds the code for FreeBSD packages of the Darwin
CalendarServer.

py-kerberos and py-sqlparse have been committed to FreeBSD but have not been made available in the ports tree. See the links for the current status.

py-kerberos: http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=156791
py-sqlparse: http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=156828
py-pycalendar: http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=157323

There is no official tarball for the calendarserver yet.
Work is in progress for putting the tarball in this repository
and after that submitting it to FreeBSD.

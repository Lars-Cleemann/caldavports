This repository holds the code for FreeBSD packages of the Darwin
CalendarServer.

Kerberos and SQLparse have been committed to FreeBSD.
See http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=156791 and
http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=156791  for the status of these 
ports.

There are no tarballs for pycalendar and the calendarserver yet.
These ports will be committed to FreeBSD when there are 
tarballs. You can create your own tarballs.
